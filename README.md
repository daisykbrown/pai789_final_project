# Investigating Flood Risk and Equity in North Carolina

## Background

As temperatures increase, communities across the globe are expected to experience more extreme weather events. In North Carolina, the state currently experiences both coastal and inland flooding, and is expected to have more flood events due to climate change. Smaller, lower-resourced populations are specifically going to experience the brunt of climate impacts because as these communities experience more natural disasters, residents and employers leave and their tax bases dwindle, thus making it harder to fund basic services. This repository investigates Columbus County specifically, but future work can utilize the resources included as a foundation to build upon. This repository was created with the goal of helping policy makers and communities better understand their flood risk. Specifically, this repository uses data from FEMA, the state of North Carolina, and the U.S. Census Bureau to calculate: 

1) The expected depth of flooding (in feet) for parcels that stand in FEMA’s 1% annual flood chance zone

2) Block group-level demographic characteristics that were chosen based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Environmental Justice Indicators. These demographics are at the block-group level and include: 
⋅⋅* The percent of the population that is non-white hispanic
⋅⋅* The percent of households where the household income is less than or equal to twice the federal "poverty level”
⋅⋅* The unemployment rate
⋅⋅* The percent of households who do not speak English or do not speak English “very well”
⋅⋅* The percent of people age 25 or older in a block group whose education is short of a high school diploma
⋅⋅* The percent of people who are under age 5
⋅⋅* The percent of people who are over age 5

The block-group characteristics not guided by the EPA’s Environmental Justice Indicators but also included in the analysis are:
⋅⋅* The percent of buildings occupied
⋅⋅* The percent of buildings owner-occupied
⋅⋅* Median Income
